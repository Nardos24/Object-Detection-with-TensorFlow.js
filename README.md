# Object Detection with TensorFlow.js

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using TensorFlow.js and the COCO-SSD model. It captures video from your webcam, processes it for object detection, and displays the results on an HTML canvas.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using the COCO-SSD model.
- Webcam video feed processed to identify and label objects.
- Lightweight and runs directly in the browser.

## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser that supports WebRTC and the necessary JavaScript APIs (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- An active internet connection to load TensorFlow.js and the COCO-SSD model from the CDN.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nardos24/Object-Detection-with-TensorFlow.js.git
   cd object-detection

2. Open index.html in a modern web browser.

Note: No server setup is required; it works as a standalone web app.
## Usage
Ensure your webcam is connected.
Open the app in your browser.
Click the Start Detection button to begin detecting objects in real-time.
Click Stop Detection to stop detection (pause)
